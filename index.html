        <p class="p-icon">Hi I'm Chel! I am a mixed ethnicity youth living in the Louisville Area. Growing up I was fortunate to have parents who believed that I should be able to see myself in the books, educational materials, and toys that I play with. My parents were able to secure books that dealt with cultural identity and ethic pride. They even ordered dolls that embrace my asian eyes, curly hair and brown skin glow! My hope is that the products that I send out bring that same empowerment to the next generation of girls who are looking for multi-ethnic &amp; multicultural or just wanting to find books where they are able to see themselves in. 10 percent of all purchases will be given to local youth organizations in the Louisville area!</p>
